- Task 1 : Create a function that takes a string as input and returns the reversed version of the string without using the built-in reverse() method. 

**Example `Input: "hello world"` Example `Output: "dlrow olleh"`**


- Task 2 : Create a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns the sum of all positive numbers in the array. 

**Example `Input: [2, -5, 10, -3, 7]` Example` Output: 19`**


- Task 3: Write a JavaScript program to find the most frequent element in an array and return it. 

**Example `Input: [3, 5, 2, 5, 3, 3, 1, 4, 5]` Example `Output: 3`**


- Task 4: Create a function that takes a sorted array of numbers and a target value as input. The function should find two numbers in the array that add up to the target value. Return an array containing the indices of the two numbers.

 **Example `Input: ([1, 3, 6, 8, 11, 15], 9)` Example `Output: [1, 2] (numbers at indices 1 and 2: 3 + 6 = 9)`**
